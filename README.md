## Introduction

PRTG Network Monitor is an enterprise-level monitoring platform created to give IT teams comprehensive insight into their networks, systems, and applications. Its modular, sensor-driven design makes it possible to track nearly any component, from bandwidth consumption and server resources to virtualized platforms, cloud services, databases, and IoT devices. Support for a broad set of monitoring technologies—including SNMP, WMI, SSH, HTTP(S), packet capture, REST APIs, and custom scripts—allows PRTG to operate effectively in diverse and complex environments.

The solution provides live dashboards, interactive maps, and detailed historical analytics that help administrators quickly spot anomalies, performance slowdowns, or service failures. A built-in alerting mechanism delivers notifications through multiple channels such as email, SMS, push alerts, and integrations with service desks or collaboration platforms. Flexible thresholds and escalation workflows ensure that critical events are highlighted without overwhelming teams with unnecessary alerts.

PRTG supports distributed monitoring using remote probes, enabling centralized management of multiple locations or segmented networks in a secure manner. Automated discovery and an intuitive web-based interface reduce setup time and simplify daily administration. With extensive customization options, API access, and REST-based sensors, PRTG scales well for both growing organizations and large enterprises seeking a unified approach to proactive infrastructure and network monitoring.
